The idea was to setup and manage my flashes so that I could shot any format without having to play around with repositioning equipment. My go to was 35mm but loved 120. This occasion I was setting up for three photos. Telephoto for 35mm, then 6x6 fisheye and lastly telephoto. Ironic cause only one of the three would be used for print. “What if we could use all three?” I thought as I bugged Trent Fahey(Emerica) to do a couple more. The first shot was a “test” photo and I could then swap cameras. :D Once the riders knew about 120, it became a preference. Although the 35mm version was used for editorial, my favourite is the fisheye shot with the tiny sunset. Matching the telephoto perspective meant that I could also use one tripod for both the 35mm and 120. You can see how the image ratio varies using the same perspective but I only had to add another quick release plate. With the three captured the idea was complete, a fun exercise to keep active mid Soul Tech Australia tour 02'.
