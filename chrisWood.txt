Ironic that he skates more vert now then street but a ripper regardless. I flew into Adelaide for the first time and it was the beginning of the Boom Tour. Bonham said to look out for two skaters. That would be Dion Johnson and Chris Wood. Throughout the tour Chris killed it, without any push from myself. More so, "Hurry up and setup, Chris is going to land it!" Needless to say watching his current Insta clips on vert, shows nothings changed other than time. Always a pleasure.
