As it was a 100 years ago, I don’t remember the full details of the day but what I do remember is the composition. With film, I found that you literally had to envision your final print and build it up from there. I didn’t just want a standard sequence. I needed to showcase the main element of the trick but also convey to the designer the composition of the final print. When handing photos over to editors, you don’t want to give them a reason to say “no”. This worked great cause I never actually mentioned anything to the designer and it came out as envisioned. :D
