Sidney Tapia. Where to start? He was one Sydney's first, to take me seriously and it just went from there. Previously him and some others were going to start CLS. I did my research and was excited for what this was to become. Sadly CLS was more concept but Sidney had always maintained that image, "class". From what I knew of him, he was who I wanted to be. A humble, clean cut individual with a personality to match. Working hand and hand was never an issue and we always got results. Nowadays nothing has changed other than the fact he's more of a role model/mentor than ever imagined. Thank you Sir for putting your all into what we did. "By all means..." :D
