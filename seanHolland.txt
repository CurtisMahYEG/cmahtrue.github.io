This was the first occasion which I met Sean. Morg's had mentioned previously that he was leaving ASM and that Mr. Holland was taking over. There was a contest/demo at Taren Point and he'd be there. I was to introduce myself and take some snap's. Morg's mentioned that Sean was a skater, so rest assured I'd be in good hands with him becoming editor. Little did I know that he could skate so well. I don't think I even skated but shot tonnes of photos. I noticed Sean skating the mini. I moved my flashes over and quickly shot this Noseblunt slide. Nothing better than knowing your editor can skate better than you. Thank you Mr. Holland for all the opportunities which you gave myself. #thankyouskateboarding
