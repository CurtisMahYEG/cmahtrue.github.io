<p>This was the first occasion which I met Sean. Morg&#39;s had mentioned 
previously that he was leaving ASM and that Mr. Holland was taking over. 
There was a contest/demo at Taren Point and he&#39;d be there. I was to 
introduce myself and take some snap&#39;s. Morg&#39;s mentioned that Sean is a skater, 
so rest assured I&#39;d be in good hands with him becoming editor. Little did I 
know that he could skate so well. I don&#39;t think I even skated but shot tonnes 
of photos. I noticed Sean skating the mini. I moved my flashes over and quickly 
shot this Noseblunt slide. Nothing better than knowing your editor can skate 
better than you. </p>
<p>Thank you Mr. Holland for all the opportunities which you gave myself.
