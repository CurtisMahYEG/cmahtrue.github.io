<p>The idea was to setup and manage my flashes so that I could shot any format 
without having to play around with repositioning equipment. My go to was 35mm 
but loved 120. This occasion I was setting up for three photos. Telephoto for 
35mm, then 6x6 fisheye and lastly telephoto. Ironic cause only one of the three 
would be used for print. “What if we could use all three?” I thought as I bugged 
Trent Fahey(Emerica) to do a couple more. The first shot was a “test” photo and 
I could then swap cameras. :D Once the riders knew about 120, it became a 
preference. Although the 35mm version was used for editorial, my favourite is 
the fisheye shot with the tiny sunset. Matching the telephoto perspective meant 
that I could also use one tripod for both the 35mm and 120. You can see how the 
image ratio varies using the same perspective but I only had to add another quick 
release plate. With the three captured the idea was complete, a fun exercise to 
keep active mid Soul Tech Australia tour 02&#39;.</p>
