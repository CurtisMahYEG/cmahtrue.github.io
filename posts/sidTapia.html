<p>Sidney Tapia. Where to start? He was one Sydney&#39;s first, to take me 
seriously and it just went from there. Previously him and some 
others were going to start CLS. I did my research and was excited for 
what this was to become. Sadly CLS was more concept but Sidney had always 
maintained that image, &quot;class&quot;. From what I knew of him, he was who I 
wanted to be. A humble, clean cut individual with a personality to match. 
Working hand and hand was never an issue and we always got results. 
Nowadays nothing has changed other than the fact he&#39;s more of a role model/mentor 
than ever imagined. Thank you Sir for putting your all into what we did. 
&quot;By all means...&quot; :D</p>
