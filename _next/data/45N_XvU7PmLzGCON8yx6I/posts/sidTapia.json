Where to start? He was one Sydney's first, to take me \r\nseriously and it just went from there. Previously him and some \r\nothers were going to start CLS. I did my research and was excited for \r\nwhat this was to become. Sadly CLS was more concept but Sidney had always \r\nmaintained that image, \"class\". From what I knew of him, he was who I \r\nwanted to be. A humble, clean cut individual with a personality to match. \r\nWorking hand and hand was never an issue and we always got results. \r\nNowadays nothing has changed other than the fact he's more of a role model/mentor \r\nthan ever imagined. Thank you Sir for putting your all into what we did. \r\n\"By all means...\" :D\r\n\r\n## @sid.tapia 01'\r\n## NBSTS\r\n## Sydney, Australia","slug":"sidTapia"},"__N_SSG":true}
