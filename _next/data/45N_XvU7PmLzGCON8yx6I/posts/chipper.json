He actually got me to break a \r\nmold/standard back in the day. \"Don't worry about it, he won't care.\" \r\nWhat I'm referring to is that if you shot a new photo at a spot that's \r\nbeen already published then the new photo must be a different angle. \r\nWell that's what I tried to maintain. Initially Skin had a photo published \r\nfrom this angle so I avoided it for a couple years. With what I wanted to \r\ndo, there was no other angle so tried to make it look completely different. \r\nI wanted to show the length of the spot so it would compliment the trick, \r\nintergrate with my idea/concept and to not get run over by a taxi drivers. \r\nThe lane is for the \"on ramp\" to the Harbour Bridge hence the speed bump. \r\nTaxi drivers will run you over. Through out the day, things progressed and \r\neventually we stock piled enough to lead up to his interview. \r\nSequences can be overlooked so I tried to supply scans (psd/tiff) whenever \r\npossible and this time a morphed psd. Having a finished piece of artwork \r\nthat could be dropped into Quark (pre-Indesign) meant Morg's could confirm \r\nrunning this and we had a lead into his interview. We actually shot a bit \r\nwhile he was in Sydney and was a great excuse to head to Perth to finish.  \r\nMost importantly he was correct about Skin. #thankyouskateboarding\r\n\r\n## @therealwaltz1 02'\r\n## FS NoseSlide\r\n## Aquarium, Sydney","slug":"chipper"},"__N_SSG":true}
