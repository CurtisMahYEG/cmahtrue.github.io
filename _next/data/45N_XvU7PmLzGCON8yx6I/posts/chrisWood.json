Bonham said to look out for two skaters. That would be \r\nDion Johnson and Chris Wood. Throughout the tour Chris killed it, without \r\nany push from myself. More so, \"Hurry up and setup, Chris is going to \r\nland it!\" Needless to say watching his current Insta clips on vert, shows \r\nnothings changed other than time. Always a pleasure.\r\n\r\n## @chriswouldnt 99'\r\n## about to die\r\n## GoldCoast, Australia","slug":"chrisWood"},"__N_SSG":true}
