Morg's had mentioned \r\npreviously that he was leaving ASM and that Mr. Holland was taking over. \r\nThere was a contest/demo at Taren Point and he'd be there. I was to \r\nintroduce myself and take some snap's. Morg's mentioned that Sean is a skater, \r\nso rest assured I'd be in good hands with him becoming editor. Little did I \r\nknow that he could skate so well. I don't think I even skated but shot tonnes \r\nof photos. I noticed Sean skating the mini. I moved my flashes over and quickly \r\nshot this Noseblunt slide. Nothing better than knowing your editor can skate \r\nbetter than you. \r\n\r\nThank you Mr. Holland for all the opportunities which you gave myself. \r\n#thankyouskateboarding \r\n\r\n## @theskateboardersjournal 00'\r\n## FSNBS\r\n## Taren Point Vert X\r\n\r\n\r\n","slug":"seanHolland"},"__N_SSG":true}
