My go to was 35mm \r\nbut loved 120. This occasion I was setting up for three photos. Telephoto for \r\n35mm, then 6x6 fisheye and lastly telephoto. Ironic cause only one of the three \r\nwould be used for print. “What if we could use all three?” I thought as I bugged \r\nTrent Fahey(Emerica) to do a couple more. The first shot was a “test” photo and \r\nI could then swap cameras. :D Once the riders knew about 120, it became a \r\npreference. Although the 35mm version was used for editorial, my favourite is \r\nthe fisheye shot with the tiny sunset. Matching the telephoto perspective meant \r\nthat I could also use one tripod for both the 35mm and 120. You can see how the \r\nimage ratio varies using the same perspective but I only had to add another quick \r\nrelease plate. With the three captured the idea was complete, a fun exercise to \r\nkeep active mid Soul Tech Australia tour 02'.\r\n\r\n## @slamskateboarding 02'\r\n## FS Smith\r\n## Bunbury, WA","slug":"trentFaye"},"__N_SSG":true}
